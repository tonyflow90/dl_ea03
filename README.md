Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple — informed by too few features or regularized too much — which makes it inflexible in learning from the dataset. Simple learners tend to have less variance in their predictions but more bias towards wrong outcomes.

Overfitting is a modeling error in statistics that occurs when a function is too closely aligned to a limited set of data points. ... Thus, attempting to make the model conform too closely to slightly inaccurate data can infect the model with substantial errors and reduce its predictive power.
